# Bootstrap-Real-Estate-Project
This project dispalys the basic use of Bootstrap and how it makes coding in Html and CSS simpler. 
To get started with this project, I first downloaded Bootstrap files from the Bootstrap webiste and made adjustments as I intergrated the theme into my HTML and CSS. 
For this project I collaborated with the instructors from the Visiola Foundation Bootcamp and it is with their guidance that I was able to finish it. 
Feel free to fork it, redesign it and recreate it as you see fit.
